Both groups displayed aggravated plaque formation; nevertheless it was merely statistically significant in the control group (F (3,27) =12.88, p<0.001). The plaque indices in trial and control groups increased toward day 1 (p=0.19 and p=0.006 respectively) which continued to aggravate till day 3 (p=0.28 and P=0.54 respectively), along with final declination in both groups (p =0.002 and p= 0.13 respectively). Effect size for outcomes calculated for mean difference of each index for either groups measured by mentioned schedule.
